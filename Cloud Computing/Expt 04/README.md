# Experiment 04

On the VPC and VM created in experiment #2, deploy a "Hello World" Java web application. Control the application by creating a load balancer and API gateway or service registry. Define rules to limit access to few users. Validate the rules are working, by trying to access the webpage.

## Cloud security feature: 
Cloud application access

## Expected outcome:
Application should be working only for users access. Others should get access denied.
