## Software Testing Laboratory
The Software Testing Laboratory experiments focus on:
- **Manual and Automated Testing** techniques.
- **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)** and **Equivalence Partitioning**.
- **Test Case Design** and unit testing with **JUnit**.
- **Automation Tools** like Selenium and **Load Testing** with JMeter.

### List of Experiments:
1. **Expt 01**: Test Case Design for a Banking Application
2. **Expt 02**: Boundary Value Analysis for Commission Calculation
3. **Expt 03**: Automated Web Testing using Selenium
